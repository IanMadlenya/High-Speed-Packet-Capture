# High Speed Packet Capture
![alt tag](http://appgallery.maxeler.com/v0.1/app/High%20Speed%20Packet%20Capture/icon)
### Description
Provides line-rate packet capture at bursts of up to 24GB in size. The application configures pairs of DFE SFP ports into “tapped” pass through connections. Ethernet data is captured from the tapped ports, packets are accurately timestamped and written out to pcap files. The DFE implementation can filter traffic at line rate and can also be extended to guarantee lossless packet capture at 40GE and 100GE, given a sufficiently large storage back-end.
